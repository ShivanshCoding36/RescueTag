2) Ambulance Drivers: Faster response by bypassing traffic.  
3) Hospitals: Better readiness with real-time updates.  
4) Traffic Authorities: Optimized traffic flow during emergencies.  

Impact: The system cuts response times by dynamically adjusting traffic lights and ensures hospitals are prepared, improving patient outcomes and emergency response efficiency.
